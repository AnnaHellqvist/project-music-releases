# Music Releases

The assignment was to build a music release site with react components.

## The problem

We started by building the component structure, used the .map function to map through the data and show the different cards with information.
We used props to add the right data. In CSS we used flexbox to position our components. The page is responsive with different layout for mobile, tablet and desktop. 

If we had more time we would've tried some black level requirements.
